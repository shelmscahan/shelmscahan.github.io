						<p>The research in my lab focuses on the consequences of sociality on the evolution of individual, population, and species characteristics. The evolution of social groups is a fundamental transition that has occurred in a diverse array of organisms, from bacteria to primates. I use the tools of ecology, ethology, and genetics to understand how social life affects the evolution and dynamics of ant populations, primarily in the southwestern and southern US. Ants are obligately social animals, organized into highly structured colonies containing one or more reproductive queens and a large number of female but reproductively sterile workers. The only component of the ant life cycle in which solitary life is possible is when young queens leave their parent nests to found their own new colonies, yet even at this stage queens of many species choose to join forces with other queens to form group nests rather than live solitarily. By living together, ants interact with their environment as a group, which can dramatically change their ability to tolerate environmental extremes, their interactions with members of their own and other species, and their patterns of dispersal and reproductive behaviors.

Our investigations focus on two main study systems. The first is the desert harvester ant Messor pergandei, in which the behavior of queens switches abruptly from solitary colony founding to group colony founding across its range in southern California. Current projects include: 1) quantifying gene flow across the behavioral transition zone, 2) measuring the types and strength of natural selection acting on queen behavior, both between regions and within the transition zone, and 3) the effects of social behavior on queen body size, morphology, and physiology.

Our second project is social insect hybrid zones, where the interaction between social structure and interspecific hybridization has led to some surprising and unique forms of interspecific interactions. We study two hybrid zones, one in the harvester ant genus Pogonomyrmex and the other between two North American fire ant species in the genus Solenopsis. In both these cases, hybrid offspring almost always become sterile workers, while non-hybrids are invariably reproductive offspring. Ongoing projects include the evolutionary origin and geographic distribution of genetic caste determination, how differences in caste fate of genetically different offspring are mediated within the colony, the role of selection in maintaining genetic caste systems, and the current and historical genetic relationships between hybridizing populations.</p><br>

						<p>Research in the Helms laboratory uses social insects as model systems to develop and test basic theory in ecology and evolution. The laboratory addresses questions of broad significance, often on large geographic scales. Projects range from the study of sex ratio evolution in social insects, to the importance of ecological interactions among invasive species, to studies of the evolution of cooperation, conflict and cooperative breeding. While we make extensive use of modern techniques from fields such as molecular genetics, phylogeography, and geographic information systems, our research is grounded in the importance of understanding the natural history of species in their environment.</p>

							<p>Climate change is predicted to result in increased average temperatures and climate variability across the globe. Shifts in climate are likely to affect the distribution, quality, and quantity of essential nutritional resources for terrestrial consumers, while at the same time changing their nutritional requirements. Understanding how these shifts will affect the success of organisms is crucial to be able to accurately predict species responses to climate change.<p>
							<p>Thus, I am broadly interested in how organisms allocate nutrients in a thermally variable environment. My current work focuses on deciduous forest ants in the genus Aphaenogaster. They are an ideal model system to study the nutritional effects of climate change because they occur across a wide thermal gradient, distinct nutritional resources are used by different ant colony members, they are numerically abundant, and they provide essential ecosystem services. The bulk of my work aims to link the nutritional ecology and thermal biology of ants to biogeochemistry, organismal performance, functional traits, and biochemical characteristics of ants. Please see my <a href="https://katieamiller.wordpress.com/">website</a> for more information.

							<p>Many organisms face extinction and/or range shifts to future climate change unless they are able to stay in place by acclimating or adapting. Ants are a great taxonomic group to study species responses to climate change, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with variable environments. What mechanisms, characteristics, and abilities allow some species to persist better than others?</p>
							<p>One way to understand species vulnerability or resiliency to pending temperature shifts is to investigate how different species have historically adapted to changing climates, which is the main goal of my dissertation. For this work, I combine field work, lab studies, and computational approaches (statistics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics) to determine the extent to which species' physiologies match their thermal environment.</p><br>
