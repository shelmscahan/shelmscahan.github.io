Amanda is a 5th year Ph.D candidate who studies aquatic microbial communities - how they change as a result of organic matter enrichment and how such changes can be applied to management of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. She uses the Sarracenia purpurea microecosyem and a combination of meta -omics techniques and greenhouse experiments to explore the changes in structure and function of microbial communities in response to organic enrichment and the influence of these processes on ecosystem dynamics.

 Jhanavi is a junior at the University of Vermont who joined the ant lab in the summer of 2018. Jhanavi colleced, in all, 10 colonies of <i>Aphaenogaster spp</i>. from local woodlands on and off campus and fed them a variety of diets for 3 week periods. She then performed cold shock treatments to determine what effect, if any, certain diets have on CCRT (recovery time). The data Jhanavi has collected can help us better understand the adaptations our Hymenoptera friends may use to protect against the negative effects of climate variability. </p>

Juvenile Hormone is a pleiotropic hormone responsible for many different functions in insects, but in eusocial insects such as bees, wasps, and ants it serves the function of regulating age related tasks, also known as temporal polyethism. Increased levels of Juvenile Hormone that accumulate with age have shown to lead to older ants foraging outside of the colony as opposed to brood and nest care inside of the colony. By manipulating levels of Juvenile Hormone in worker ants the hypothesis is formed that higher levels of Juvenile Hormone added to the ants would result in the Experimental Ants having an earlier onset and intensity of foraging. However, collected data suggests that levels of added Juvenile Hormone tend to inhibit foraging behavior in Pogonomyrmex barbatus ants, resulting in the need for future research to determine the reasons behind the inhibition. </p>
