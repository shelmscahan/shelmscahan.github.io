						<h3><b> Michael Herrmann, PhD Candidate </b></h3>
						<img src="/assets/images/Field Picture.jpg"><br>
							<p>I am a 6th year Ph.D Candidate in the Helms Cahan lab. My research  
focuses on sexual conflict and chemical communication in hybridizing  
harvester ants. Due to the unusual genetic caste determination system  
found in certain species of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants, males and  
queens receive different fitness payoffs from mating. I study how this  
difference in fitness plays out during mating swarms in these species.  
In addition, my research studies how cuticular hydrocarbons play a  
role in this conflict. I am also interested analyzing and  
understanding the evolutionary tradeoffs expected in cuticular  
hydrocarbons, due to their role as both communication cues, as well as  
their use in water-proofing the cuticle of insects. I have also done  
work on linkage mapping in Pogonomyrmex ants, as well as quantitative  
trait loci analysis on cuticular hydrocarbons.</p>

							<p>Climate change is predicted to result in increased average temperatures and climate variability across the globe. Shifts in climate are likely to affect the distribution, quality, and quantity of essential nutritional resources for terrestrial consumers, while at the same time changing their nutritional requirements. Understanding how these shifts will affect the success of organisms is crucial to be able to accurately predict species responses to climate change.<p>
							<p>Thus, I am broadly interested in how organisms allocate nutrients in a thermally variable environment. My current work focuses on deciduous forest ants in the genus Aphaenogaster. They are an ideal model system to study the nutritional effects of climate change because they occur across a wide thermal gradient, distinct nutritional resources are used by different ant colony members, they are numerically abundant, and they provide essential ecosystem services. The bulk of my work aims to link the nutritional ecology and thermal biology of ants to biogeochemistry, organismal performance, functional traits, and biochemical characteristics of ants.

						<h3> <b>Lucia Orantes, PhD Candidate </b></h3>
						<img src="/assets/images/prof1.jpg"><br>
							<p> Co-advised by Sara Helms Cahan in the Biology Department and Kimberly Wallin in in Natural Resources at RSENR. Lucia studies the landscape genetics and dispersion patterns of the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma dimidiata, in Guatemala. She is funded by an NSF Evolution and Ecology of Infectious Diseases grant.</p>

							<p>Many organisms face extinction and/or range shifts to future climate change unless they are able to stay in place by acclimating or adapting. Ants are a great taxonomic group to study species responses to climate change, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with variable environments. What mechanisms, characteristics, and abilities allow some species to persist better than others?</p>
							<p>One way to understand species vulnerability or resiliency to pending temperature shifts is to investigate how different species have historically adapted to changing climates, which is the main goal of my dissertation. For this work, I combine field work, lab studies, and computational approaches (statistics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics) to determine the extent to which species' physiologies match their thermal environment.</p><br>
