<h2> <a href="http://adnguyen.github.io/">Andrew D. Nguyen, Evolutionary Physiologist</a> </h2>

 <p> Andrew successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation in March of 2017 at the University of Vermont. His research focused on understanding species vulneralbility or resiliency to pending temperature shifts by investigating how different species have historically adapted to changing climates. For this work Andrew combined lab studies, field work, and computational approaches (statistics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics) to determine the extent to which species' physiologies match their thermal environment.</p>

<p> Andrew has taken a post-doctoral research position in <a href="http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/hahn/lab/danhahn.htm">Dr. Dan Hahn's</a> lab at the University of Florida. Begining in July of 2017, Andrew will be looking at how insects interact with their environment and physiological mechansims of environmental stress resistance.

                            <p>Michael's research in the Helms/Helms Cahan lab  
focused on sexual conflict and chemical communication in hybridizing  
harvester ants. Due to the unusual genetic caste determination system  
found in certain species of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants, males and  
queens receive different fitness payoffs from mating. I study how this  
difference in fitness plays out during mating swarms in these species.  
In addition, my research studied how cuticular hydrocarbons play a  
role in this conflict. I was also interested analyzing and  
understanding the evolutionary tradeoffs expected in cuticular  
hydrocarbons, due to their role as both communication cues, as well as  
their use in water-proofing the cuticle of insects. I have also completed  
work on linkage mapping in Pogonomyrmex ants, as well as quantitative  
trait loci analysis on cuticular hydrocarbons.</p>

<img src="images/prof1.jpg"alt="" data-position="25% 25%" /></a><br>
                            <p> Co-advised by Sara Helms Cahan in the Biology Department and Kimberly Wallin in in Natural Resources at RSENR. Lucia studied the landscape genetics and dispersion patterns of the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma dimidiata, in Guatemala. She was funded by an NSF Evolution and Ecology of Infectious Diseases grant.</p></li>
			<p> Lucia is currently working as an Epidemiologist at the Vermont Department of Health where she creates and manages the Vermont Birth Information Network for Zika Response as part of the CDC's efforts to establish a country-wide active surveillance of adverse outcomes possibly linked to Zika virus infection during pregnancy.
