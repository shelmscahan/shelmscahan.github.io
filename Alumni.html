 <p> Andrew successfully defended his dissertation in March of 2017, earning himself a Ph.D in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Vermont.  </p>

 <p>Many organisms face extinction and/or range shifts to future climate change unless they are able to stay in place by acclimating or adapting. Ants are a great taxonomic group to study species responses to climate change, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with variable environments. What mechanisms, characteristics, and abilities allow some species to persist better than others?</p>
                            <p>One way to understand species vulnerability or resiliency to pending temperature shifts is to investigate how different species have historically adapted to changing climates, which is the main goal of my dissertation. For this work, I combine field work, lab studies, and computational approaches (statistics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics) to determine the extent to which species' physiologies match their thermal environment.</p><br>

<img src="images/MichaelHerm.jpg"><br>
                            <p>Michael's research in the Helms/Helms Cahan lab  
focused on sexual conflict and chemical communication in hybridizing  
harvester ants. Due to the unusual genetic caste determination system  
found in certain species of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants, males and  
queens receive different fitness payoffs from mating. I study how this  
difference in fitness plays out during mating swarms in these species.  
In addition, my research studied how cuticular hydrocarbons play a  
role in this conflict. I was also interested analyzing and  
understanding the evolutionary tradeoffs expected in cuticular  
hydrocarbons, due to their role as both communication cues, as well as  
their use in water-proofing the cuticle of insects. I have also completed  
work on linkage mapping in Pogonomyrmex ants, as well as quantitative  
trait loci analysis on cuticular hydrocarbons.</p>
