**Reagent Preparations**



**Procedure**

1. Put each ant (stored in -80°C freezer, or in 95% ethanol,or in RNAlater) into a 1.5 ml screw tube, then put the tube into a foam box containing liquid nitrogen.

2. Take the tube out of liquid nitrogen, while the ant is still frozen, crush it (in particular the head) using a clean plastic pestle.

3. Add 200 ul buffer ATL and one scoop of beads (zirconium silicate beads, 1.4mm) into each tube. Close the cap tightly, place the tubesin  Bullet Blender.****

4. Run at maximum speed for 3 min (run the Blender again when necessary).

    (\**Alternatively**, add 200 ul ATL buffer in a 1.5 ml tube, put the ant into the tube and grind it with a clean plastic pestle.  Note: Homogenize ants without ATL buffer would result in DNA degradation.) 

5. Centrifuge the tubes for 2 min at the maximum speed.

6. Add 20 ul of proteinase K into each tube, vortex well.

7. Incubate at 56°C for 1-3 hours (or overnight).

8.   Centrifuge the tubes at the maximum speed for 2-3 min.

9. Transfer the supernatant to a 1.5 ml tube (around 200ul in total). Add **1-3 ul**  RNase A solution (4mg/ml) to the lysate, mix the sample by inverting the tube 2–5 times. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for at least 15 minutes, and then cool to room temperature. *(Follow the Qiagen protocol after this step.)*
10. Add 200 μl Buffer AL to the sample,  mix thoroughly by vortexing. Incubate at 56°C for 10 min.            Add 200 μl ethanol (96–100%) to the sample and mix thoroughly by vortexing.
11. Pipette the mixture from step 4 (including any precipitate) into the DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube (provided). Centrifuge at ≥6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Discard flow-through and collection tube.
12. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2ml collection tube, add 500 μl Buffer AW1, and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6000 x g (8000 rpm). Discard flow-through and collection tube.
13. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2ml collection tube (provided), add 500 μl Buffer AW2, and centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 x g (14,000 rpm) to dry the DNeasy membrane. Discard flow-through and collection tube.
14. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a clean1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube, and pipet **40-50****μl **Buffer AE** **(adjust the amount based on the size of the ant) directly onto the DNeasy membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 1 min, then centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6000 x g (8000 rpm) to elute. (The optional concentration is 25 ng/ul or greater.)
