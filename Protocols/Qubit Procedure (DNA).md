1.      Calculate the amount of buffer and dye that you will need.

-         199 x (number of samples + 2) = uL Buffer
-         mL of Buffer/200 = uL of dye

2. Create a master mix containing buffer and dye (dye degrades quickly due to light sensitivity so only add when ready to proceed).

3. Label sample tubes and add 198uL master mix and 2ul DNA to each (be sure to keep track by numbering all tubes). 

4.  Label the two standard tubes S1 and S2 and add 190uL master mix. Then add 10ul of either standard 1 or standard 2. 

5. Very briefly vortex each tube to eliminate bubbles, be sure all bubbles are gone and no droplets exist on the sides or lid of the tube.

6. Turn on Qubit by touching the screen. Select "DNA". Select "DNA high sensitivity". Select "read new standard". Select "yes".

7. Wipe every tube before 

8. Run standards first.

9. Run samples.
