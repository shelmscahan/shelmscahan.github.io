**Reagent Preparation**



**Rationale**

The goal of this experiment is to be able to characterize entomopathogenic fungi in *Pogonomyrmex *species (*P. barbatus*, *P. rugosus*, H lineage and J lineage) using pupa as bait to isolate the fungi. 

The second goal of this experiment is to test for differences among habitats of *P. barbatus*, *P. rugosus*, H lineage and J lineage. Diversity and infection frequency of fungi will be obtained for each species. 

Since these populations have differences in habitat I expect to see greater diversity and infection frequency of fungi in populations of higher precipitation habitat than populations of lower precipitation habitat (*P.barbatus* > H, J> *P.rugosus*). 

The second part of this method will involve disease resistance among species (*P. barbatus*, *P. rugosus*, H lineage and J lineage). Hybrids populations are more genetically diverse than the parental populations; therefore I expect to see a higher resistance to disease in hybrid populations than in either of the parental species (H; J > *P.barbatus*> *P.rugosus*).

**Procedure**

Experimental Set-up

1. Soil samples of each location will be passed through a 2.0 mm sieve and grinded. There will be one pooled of soil sample for habitat of each species:  *P.barbatus*, *P. rugosus*, H lineageand J lineage. Three soil samples from colonies of three sites collected for each species will be pooled and homogenized. 
2. 7g of grinded soil sample will be placed in 35x10mm petri dish and will be moisted with a small amount of purified water (2 to 3 drops). (Note: the soil should not look mud-like consistency.)
3. For each soil sample (petri dish plate), one *Pogonomyrmex* pupa will be added, seal the plates with parafilm and incubate at 25°C for 15 days. Soil samples will be examined every day. For each soil type and ant type there will be 20 replicates, having a total of 360 plates. As a control we will place one *Pogonomyrmex* pupa of each species (P. barbatus*, *P. rugosus*, H lineage and J lineage) in individual petri dishes with a moist filter paper. 

**Data collection**

1. When signs of fungal growth are visible or the pupa is dead, pupa will be removed from the petri dish and wash with 10% Bleach for 3 minutes, under a fume hood.
2. After washing with bleach, they will be washed three times (x3) with distilled water (10mL of dH2O in a small weighting dish).
3. Pupae will be placed in small petri dish plate with a moist filter paper to provided a high moisture environment, seal the plates with parafilm and incubate at 25°C for 15 days. Samples will be examined every 2 days.
4. When signs of fungal growth are visible, DNA extraction will be performed using the Purification of Total DNA from Plant Tissue.
5. After extractions are performed, amplification of DNA will be done using the Pogo 52 program and samples will be sent for sequencing.
